                <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. 
                    I've looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing 
                    experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
                    I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-andmost grueling-time of my life.
                    Since completing the course, I've successfully switched career, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

                <br>
                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. 
                    I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn 
                    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a formal student
                    of theirs who can only wonderful things about the program. The entire
                    curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never 
                    had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, 
                    was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no 
                    tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews 
                    as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as 
                    a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
